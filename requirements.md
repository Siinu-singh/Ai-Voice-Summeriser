Voice Notes with AI Summarization (MERN + GenAI)
## Objective    sample UI image
Build a Voice Notes Application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with GenAI integration (OpenAI/Gemini API).
 The app should allow users to record voice notes, transcribe them, edit/delete them, and generate AI-powered summaries.
This assignment tests:
CRUD operations in MERN
Integration of GenAI APIs (Speech-to-Text + Summarization)
Backend + frontend communication
UI/UX handling of state updates



## Problem Statement
Users often create voice notes but find it hard to organize or revisit them later.
 Your task is to build a voice note manager where:
Users can record voice notes.
Each note is automatically transcribed into text.
Notes can be edited or deleted.
Users can generate a short summary of the note using an LLM API. Once the summary is generated, the button should be disabled until the note is edited again..
If a transcript is edited, the summary should be cleared and the “Generate Summary” button should reappear.


## Requirements
Core Features
Record & Transcribe
View Notes
Edit Note
Delete Note
Summarize Note
Persistence Data

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (hooks, axios/fetch for API calls)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB
GenAI APIs: OpenAI / Gemini (for transcription + summarization)




## Evaluation Criteria
MERN Implementation → Proper schema, APIs, and integration.
GenAI Usage → Correct use of transcription + summarization APIs.
CRUD Functionality → Working add, edit, delete, and update flows.
Logic Handling → Summary resets correctly after editing.
Code Quality → Clean, modular code with error handling.
UI/UX → Clear, simple interface with proper state updates.



## Deliverables
GitHub repository link with:


Frontend code (React)
Backend code (Node.js + Express)
README with setup instructions
Live Website link ( vercel, netlify or any other platform)
